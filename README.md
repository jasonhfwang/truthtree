# Truth Tree

Truth Tree is an experiment where the "truth" (facts) are ascertained by appending knowledge, built additively and non-destructively. New pieces of information, connected to the graph via LLM, are added to the existing graph, and the probability of parent nodes being true goes up or down depending on conflicting children (evidence / information).
